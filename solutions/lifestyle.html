        <div id="hygiene" class="remedy-section">
            <h3>Personal Hygiene for Parasite Prevention</h3>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/hygiene.png" alt="Personal Hygiene">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><strong>Importance of Hygiene:</strong> Maintaining good personal hygiene is one of the most effective ways to prevent parasite infections. Regular hand washing, particularly before eating and after using the restroom, significantly reduces the risk of ingesting parasite eggs or larvae. Additionally, proper food handling, such as washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly and cooking meat to safe temperatures, helps prevent foodborne parasites. Hygiene is also crucial when traveling to areas where parasitic infections are more common. Using safe drinking water, avoiding street food, and practicing safe sanitation can help protect against parasites.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Daily Practices:</strong> Incorporating simple hygiene practices into your daily routine can drastically reduce your risk of parasite infection. This includes keeping your nails short and clean, as parasites can hide under long nails, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in your home. Washing your clothes and bedding regularly at high temperatures also helps to eliminate any parasites that may have been brought into the home.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Travel Hygiene:</strong> When traveling, particularly to tropical or developing regions, it’s essential to be extra vigilant about hygiene. Always drink bottled or boiled water, avoid ice in drinks, and eat only freshly prepared food that has been cooked thoroughly. Using hand sanitizer when soap and water aren’t available can also help reduce the risk of contracting parasites while traveling.</p>

            <h3>Nutrition & Diet for Parasite Prevention</h3>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/nutrition.png" alt="Nutrition & Diet">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><strong>Role of Diet:</strong> A balanced diet rich in nutrients is essential for maintaining a strong immune system, which is your first line of defense against parasites. Certain foods are known for their antiparasitic properties and can help prevent infections. For example, garlic, pumpkin seeds, and pomegranates have been traditionally used to expel parasites from the body. Including these foods in your diet can create an internal environment that is hostile to parasites, making it harder for them to thrive.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Healthy Eating Habits:</strong> Adopting healthy eating habits, such as thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables, avoiding undercooked meat, and steering clear of street food in high-risk areas, can significantly reduce your chances of contracting parasites. Additionally, staying hydrated and consuming a diet high in fiber helps maintain regular bowel movements, which is crucial for expelling any parasites that may have entered your digestive system.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Foods to Include:</strong> Incorporating specific foods into your diet can help prevent and combat parasite infections. These include garlic, which is known for its antiparasitic properties; papaya seeds, which can help expel intestinal worms; and pomegranates, which have been shown to be effective against tapeworms. These foods, along with a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, can help maintain a parasite-free digestive system.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Care for Parasite Prevention</h3>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/environment.png" alt="Environmental Care">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><strong>Importance of a Clean Environment:</strong> Your immediate environment plays a significant role in preventing parasite infections. Regular cleaning and disinfection of your home, particularly high-touch areas such as doorknobs, light switches, and kitchen surfaces, can help reduce the risk of parasite transmission. Additionally, proper waste disposal and maintaining clean water sources are crucial in preventing the spread of parasites, especially in areas prone to infestations.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Parasites often enter homes through pests such as rodents, insects, and other animals. Implementing effective pest control measures, such as sealing cracks and openings, using traps or repellents, and keeping food properly stored, can help prevent pests from bringing parasites into your home. Regularly inspecting and cleaning areas where pests may enter or hide can also reduce the risk of an infestation.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Water Safety:</strong> Ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water is essential for preventing parasitic infections. If you are unsure about the quality of your tap water, consider using a water filter or boiling water before consumption. Avoid swimming in or drinking water from untreated sources, such as lakes or rivers, where parasites may be present. Safe water practices are particularly important when traveling to areas with less reliable water quality.</p>

        <!-- Physical Activity Section -->
        <div id="physical-activity" class="remedy-section">
            <h3>Physical Activity for Parasite Prevention</h3>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/physical-activity.png" alt="Physical Activity">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><strong>Exercise and Immunity:</strong> Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining a strong immune system, which is your body's primary defense against parasites. Exercise helps improve circulation, which allows immune cells to travel more efficiently throughout the body. This enhanced circulation supports the body's ability to detect and fight off parasites before they can establish an infection. Additionally, exercise helps to reduce stress, which can weaken the immune system and make the body more susceptible to infections.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Types of Exercise:</strong> Both aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, or cycling, and strength training can support immune function. Incorporating a variety of exercises into your routine ensures that all aspects of your health are supported, including cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility. Yoga and other mind-body practices can also be beneficial, as they promote relaxation and stress reduction while supporting overall health.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Regular Activity:</strong> Consistency is key when it comes to the benefits of physical activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week to keep your immune system in peak condition. Even simple activities, such as walking or gardening, can provide significant health benefits when done regularly. Staying active not only helps prevent parasitic infections but also contributes to overall well-being.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Studies:</strong> Research has shown that regular exercise boosts immune function and helps protect against infections, including those caused by parasites. Moderate exercise enhances the body's immune response, reducing the risk of illness and infection.</p>
