                    <p>Your diet plays a crucial role in determining your susceptibility to parasite infections. The foods you eat can either support your immune system, making it harder for parasites to thrive, or create an environment that is more conducive to parasite growth. Understanding the connection between diet and parasite infections can help you make better food choices to protect yourself.</p>
                    <p>For instance, diets high in sugar and refined carbohydrates can weaken your immune system and create an acidic environment in your body, which is favorable for parasites. On the other hand, a diet rich in whole foods, particularly those with antiparasitic properties like garlic, pumpkin seeds, and papaya, can help deter parasites and support your body’s natural defenses.</p>
                    <p>It’s also important to consider the hygiene and preparation of your food. Consuming undercooked meat, unwashed fruits and vegetables, or contaminated water can increase your risk of contracting parasites. Therefore, being mindful of how you prepare and store your food is just as important as what you eat.</p>

            <h2>Foods That Increase Your Risk of Parasitic Infections</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/risk-foods.png" alt="Foods That Increase Parasite Risk" class="responsive-img">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Certain foods can increase your risk of parasitic infections, particularly if they are not properly prepared or cooked. Raw or undercooked meats, such as beef, pork, and fish, are common sources of parasites like tapeworms and roundworms. These parasites can be killed by thoroughly cooking the meat to the appropriate temperatures, but consuming them raw or undercooked can lead to infection.</p>
                    <p>Unwashed fruits and vegetables can also be a source of parasites, especially if they have been contaminated with soil or water that contains parasite eggs. Washing produce thoroughly under running water and peeling fruits and vegetables when possible can help reduce the risk.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, drinking contaminated water, particularly in areas with poor sanitation, can introduce parasites like Giardia and Cryptosporidium into your system. Always drink filtered or boiled water when traveling to areas where water quality is questionable, and avoid ice made from untreated water.</p>
                    <p>For more information on foods that can increase your risk of parasitic infections, check out our <a href="../parasites-and-symptoms/index.html">Parasites & Symptoms</a> page.</p>

                <img src="../images/best-foods-parasite-cleanse.png" alt="Best Foods for Parasite Cleanse" class="responsive-img">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>If you’re looking to prevent or treat a parasitic infection, incorporating certain foods into your diet can be beneficial. Foods with natural antiparasitic properties can help to create an environment in your body that is inhospitable to parasites, making it easier to cleanse them from your system.</p>
                    <p>Garlic is one of the most well-known antiparasitic foods. It contains allicin, a compound that has been shown to kill parasites and support the immune system. Similarly, pumpkin seeds are rich in cucurbitacin, which can paralyze parasites, making them easier to expel from the body.</p>
                    <p>Other foods that support a parasite cleanse include papaya seeds, which have been traditionally used to treat intestinal worms, and fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi, which help to maintain a healthy gut flora that can prevent parasite overgrowth. Including these foods in your diet can aid in both the prevention and treatment of parasitic infections.</p>
