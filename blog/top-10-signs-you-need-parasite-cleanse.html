While some cause no symptoms, others can wreak havoc on your health. The tricky part is that parasites often cause vague symptoms that are hard to pin down. You might think you're just tired, stressed, or dealing with a common condition when parasites are the real culprit.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What Are Parasites?</h2>
        <p>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about/index.html">parasite</a> is a tiny organism that lives off another living thing, called a host. They can enter your body through contaminated water, undercooked food, bug bites, or even walking barefoot in areas where parasites are present. Common types of parasites that infect humans include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protozoa:</strong> Microscopic organisms that can live in your blood or tissues.</li>
            <li><strong>Helminths:</strong> Worm-like parasites, such as tapeworms, roundworms, and hookworms.</li>
            <li><strong>Ectoparasites:</strong> External parasites like lice, fleas, and ticks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parasites can weaken your body, steal nutrients, and leave behind toxins that disrupt your system. In some cases, they lead to long-term health problems.</p>

                <h3>Persistent Fatigue</h3>
                <p>Feeling tired all the time, even after a full nights sleep? Parasites can drain your body of essential nutrients like iron, leaving you constantly exhausted.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong> Parasites feed on your energy sources, depleting your system.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Digestive Issues</h3>
                <p>Bloating, gas, constipation, or diarrhea caused by parasites disrupting the balance of good bacteria in your gut.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong> Parasites disrupt the balance of good bacteria in your gut, leading to irritation and inflammation.</p>
                <p><strong>Other Clues:</strong> Abdominal cramping and irregular bowel movements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Unexplained Weight Changes</h3>
                <p>Weight loss or gain due to nutrient theft or inflammation caused by parasites.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong> Parasites steal nutrients from your body, causing weight loss. On the flip side, they can also cause inflammation that triggers weight gain.</p>
                <p><strong>Other Clues:</strong> Hunger even after eating or a loss of appetite.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Skin Problems</h3>
                <p>Rashes, acne, or eczema triggered by toxins released by parasites.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong> Parasites release toxins that the liver struggles to process, leading to skin flare-ups.</p>
                <p><strong>Other Clues:</strong> Dry skin, hives, or itchy patches.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p><strong>Other Clues:</strong> Chronic sinus infections or recurring fevers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Sleep Problems</h3>
                <p>Insomnia or night sweats due to active parasites at night.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong> Some parasites release toxins or cause irritation that interrupts your rest.</p>
                <p><strong>Other Clues:</strong> Waking up around the same time every night, especially between 1 and 3 a.m.</p>
            </li>

            </li>

                <h3>Food Cravings (Especially Sugar)</h3>
                <p>If you constantly crave sugar, it could be because parasites thrive on it.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong> Parasites feed on sugar, so they manipulate your cravings to get more of it.</p>
                <p><strong>Other Clues:</strong> A diet high in processed carbs or sweets.</p>
            </li>
