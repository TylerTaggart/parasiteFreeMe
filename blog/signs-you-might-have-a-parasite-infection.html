            <h2>Common Digestive Symptoms of Parasite Infections</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>One of the most telling signs of a parasite infection is digestive discomfort. Parasites often take residence in the intestines, where they can cause a range of gastrointestinal issues. Common digestive symptoms include bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. You might also experience cramping and abdominal pain, which can be mistaken for other digestive disorders.</p>
                    <p>If you notice that these symptoms persist or worsen over time, it may be an indication of a parasitic infection. In some cases, individuals may develop food sensitivities or intolerances as a result of the inflammation caused by parasites. It’s also common for those with a parasite infection to experience changes in appetite, either feeling constantly hungry or losing interest in food.</p>
                    <p>Another key sign is the presence of unexplained weight loss. Parasites can consume nutrients from the food you eat, leading to significant weight loss even if you’re eating normally. If you notice a sudden or drastic change in your weight, it’s important to consider the possibility of a parasitic infection.</p>

            <h2>Skin Issues Related to Parasite Infections</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/skin-symptoms.png" alt="Skin Symptoms of Parasite Infections" class="responsive-img">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Parasite infections can also manifest through skin problems. The skin is the body’s largest organ and often reflects what’s happening internally. Common skin-related symptoms of a parasite infection include rashes, eczema, hives, and unexplained itching. These symptoms occur because parasites release toxins that can trigger an immune response, leading to inflammation and irritation in the skin.</p>
                    <p>Some individuals may also develop sores or lesions on the skin, which can be slow to heal. In certain cases, parasites like hookworms or strongyloides can cause visible tracks or lines on the skin as they move through the body, leading to discomfort and visible changes in skin appearance.</p>
                    <p>Chronic acne, rosacea, and other persistent skin conditions can sometimes be linked to a parasitic infection. If you’ve tried various treatments for your skin issues without success, it might be worth considering a parasitic infection as a potential cause.</p>

            <h2>Systemic Symptoms: Fatigue, Brain Fog, and More</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/systemic-symptoms.png" alt="Systemic Symptoms of Parasite Infections" class="responsive-img">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>In addition to digestive and skin symptoms, parasites can cause a variety of systemic issues that affect your overall health and well-being. Chronic fatigue is one of the most common signs of a parasitic infection. This is because parasites consume your body’s nutrients, leaving you feeling drained and exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep.</p>
                    <p>Brain fog is another symptom that can indicate the presence of parasites. If you find it difficult to concentrate, experience memory issues, or feel mentally sluggish, it could be due to the toxins released by parasites, which can impair cognitive function. Mood swings, anxiety, and depression are also linked to parasitic infections, as the stress of the infection takes a toll on your mental health.</p>
                    <p>In some cases, parasitic infections can lead to more severe systemic symptoms, such as anemia, joint pain, or swollen lymph nodes. These symptoms occur because parasites can invade various parts of the body, causing widespread inflammation and immune responses. If you experience any of these symptoms, it’s important to seek medical advice to determine whether a parasite infection could be the cause.</p>
