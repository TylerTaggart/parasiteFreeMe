                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>One of the most effective ways to prevent parasite infections is by maintaining good hygiene. This involves regular handwashing with soap and water, especially before meals and after using the restroom. Washing your hands properly can prevent the transmission of parasites that may be present on surfaces, in soil, or from contact with infected individuals.</p>
                    <p>Good hygiene also extends to food preparation. Always wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, and make sure to cook meat to the appropriate temperatures to kill any parasites that might be present. Avoid consuming raw or undercooked meat and seafood, as these can be common sources of parasitic infections.</p>
                    <p>It’s also important to be mindful of hygiene in communal areas, such as public restrooms, gyms, and swimming pools. Avoid walking barefoot in these areas, and ensure that you shower after using public facilities to minimize the risk of infection.</p>

            <h2>Safe Food and Water Practices for Parasite Prevention</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Parasites can easily enter your body through contaminated food and water. To reduce your risk of infection, be vigilant about the food and water you consume. Always drink filtered or boiled water, especially when traveling to areas where water sanitation is questionable. Avoid ice in your drinks unless you are certain it has been made from safe water.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to food, be cautious about eating raw or undercooked dishes, particularly meats, fish, and shellfish. These foods can harbor parasites that are only killed by thorough cooking. Additionally, avoid eating fruits and vegetables that cannot be peeled or washed in clean water, as they may carry parasites from contaminated soil or water.</p>
                    <p>In some regions, it’s also important to be aware of local food practices that may increase the risk of parasite infections. Educate yourself about safe food and water practices before traveling, and consider taking preventive measures, such as antiparasitic supplements, during your trip.</p>
                    <p>For more information on safe food practices, check out our <a href="../solutions/foods.html">Anti-Parasitic Foods</a> section.</p>

            <h2>Avoiding Contaminated Surfaces to Prevent Parasite Infections</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/contaminated-surfaces.png" alt="Contaminated Surfaces" class="responsive-img">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Parasites can survive on various surfaces, including soil, water, and even everyday objects. To prevent parasite infections, it's important to avoid direct contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. Wear shoes when walking outside, especially in areas where animals may defecate. In rural areas or during outdoor activities, avoid touching soil or surfaces that may be contaminated with animal feces.</p>
                    <p>If you’re gardening or working in areas where soil contamination is possible, wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Pets can also be a source of parasites, so it’s important to clean up after them promptly and ensure they are regularly dewormed to minimize the risk of spreading parasites to your family.</p>
                    <p>Another important precaution is to avoid swimming in or drinking water from untreated or stagnant sources, such as ponds, lakes, and rivers. These bodies of water can be breeding grounds for parasites and other pathogens. Stick to well-maintained swimming pools or chlorinated water sources to reduce the risk of infection.</p>
