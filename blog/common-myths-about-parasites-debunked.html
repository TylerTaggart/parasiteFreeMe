                    <p>One of the most common misconceptions about parasites is that they only affect people in developing countries. While it’s true that parasitic infections are more prevalent in regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, parasites can and do affect people all over the world, including in developed countries.</p>
                    <p>In fact, some parasites are more common in industrialized nations due to lifestyle factors, such as travel, food imports, and close contact with animals. For example, parasites like Giardia and Cryptosporidium are frequently found in contaminated water sources, which can affect hikers, campers, and those who drink untreated water.</p>
                    <p>Travelers returning from tropical or subtropical regions can also bring parasites back with them, making it important to consider parasitic infections even in developed countries. Parasites do not discriminate based on geography; they can infect anyone, anywhere.</p>

            <h2>Myth 2: You Can’t Have a Parasite if You Don’t Have Symptoms</h2>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Another widespread myth is that you can’t have a parasitic infection if you’re not experiencing symptoms. The truth is that many parasitic infections can be asymptomatic, meaning you may not show any signs of illness even if you have parasites in your body.</p>
                    <p>Some parasites can lie dormant for years before causing symptoms, while others may cause mild symptoms that are easily overlooked or attributed to other conditions. For instance, fatigue, digestive issues, or skin problems might be dismissed as minor annoyances, but they could be indicative of a parasitic infection.</p>
                    <p>It’s also possible for your body to manage a parasitic infection without noticeable symptoms, especially if your immune system is strong. However, this doesn’t mean the parasites aren’t causing harm. They can still deplete your body’s nutrients and weaken your immune system over time.</p>

            <h2>Myth 3: Parasites Are Easy to Treat with Over-the-Counter Medications</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <img src="../images/parasite-myths3.png" alt="Parasite Treatment" class="responsive-img">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Many people believe that parasites are easy to treat with over-the-counter medications, but this is not always the case. While some parasitic infections can be treated with OTC remedies, many require prescription medications that target specific types of parasites. Additionally, certain parasites have developed resistance to common treatments, making them harder to eradicate.</p>
                    <p>Over-the-counter medications may also be ineffective if the wrong parasite is targeted or if the infection has advanced. For example, medications that work well for intestinal worms may not be effective against protozoan parasites like Giardia or Entamoeba.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to get a proper diagnosis from a healthcare provider if you suspect a parasitic infection. They can prescribe the appropriate treatment and ensure that the infection is fully cleared. Self-diagnosing and treating with OTC products can lead to incomplete treatment and recurring infections.</p>
